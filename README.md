# swiftCard - Personal portfolio

swiftCard is a personal portfolio vCard-style site built with **Swift**, [ElementaryUI](https://github.com/elementary-swift/elementary-ui), and **SwiftWasm**, replicating the original HTML/CSS/JS vCard template by [codewithsadee](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio). Development is powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

## Development

This project follows the same basic setup and requirements as ElementaryUI.

### Prerequisites

- Install a recent Swift toolchain (Swift 5.7+ recommended).
- Install `swiftwasm` / SwiftWasm toolchain if you plan to build for WebAssembly.
- Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) (used for the Vite dev server and asset tooling).
- Ensure `git` and `curl` are available on your PATH.
